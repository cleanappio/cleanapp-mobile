        <h4>Privacy Policy (June 13, 2023)</h4>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you visit our website or use our services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. By using our application, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h5>Information We Collect</h5>
        <p>1.1 Personal Information: We may collect personal information such as your avatar name and a blockchain address when you register in our app. Your avatar name and a blockchain address are securely stored on your device and are sent within your reports to process rewards.</p>
        <p>1.2 Usage Data: Our app collects information about your location when you use the application, i.e. take a litter or hazard report. </p>
        <h5>Use of Information</h5>
        <p>2.1 Personal Information: We use your blockchain address to process game rewards. We send points you won to your blockchain address once a day. After that we remove your avatar and &nbsp;blockchain address from your reports and your reports become anonymized. If you consent to publish reports with your avatar, we will keep your avatar connected to reports.</p>
        <p>2.2 Usage Data: We use anonymized location data to aggregate report data by certain locations and send alerts to remediators for taking action on your reports.</p>
        <h5>Information Sharing</h5>
        <p>3.1 Data Publishing: We may publish your reports with your avatar only if you consent. Otherwise all reports are published anonymously.</p>
        <p>3.2 Third-Party Service Providers: We may share your personal information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or providing services to you. These service providers have access to your personal information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>3.3 Legal Compliance: We may disclose your personal information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</p>
        <h5>Data Security</h5>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        <h5>Your Choices</h5>
        <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. You can also choose to unsubscribe from our marketing communications or adjust your preferences by contacting us at privacy@cleanapp.io.</p>
        <h5>Updates to this Privacy Policy</h5>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website or by other means of communication.</p>
        <h5>Contact Us</h5>
